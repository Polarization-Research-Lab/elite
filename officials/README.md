description: Scripts that curates information about each federal and state legislator
---

- Federal legislator data is pulled from the [unitedstates](https://github.com/unitedstates) project
- State legislator data is pulled from the [openstates](https://github.com/openstates) project

So all credit goes to them for curating all this info.

Most of the `state-legislators/*` scripts involve syncing data between our internal database and a collection of google sheets that our team manages. So, most of that code will be useless to everyone but us.
